## Abstract
Oat seed is a rich resource of beneficial lipids, soluble fiber, protein, and antioxidants. It is due to these qualities that oat is often considered a healthful food for humans. Despite these characteristics, little is known regarding the genetic drivers of variation for these compounds in oat. With this in mind, we sought to characterize natural variation in the mature seed metabolome of oat using and untargeted metabolomics approach on 378 diverse oat accessions, and to leverage this information to improve prediction for seed quality traits. We used a latent factor approach to define unobserved variables that may drive covariance among metabolites in mature oat seed. One hundred latent factors were identified, of which 21\% were enriched for compounds associated with lipid metabolism. Using a combination of whole-genome regression and association mapping, we show that latent factors that drive covariance for many metabolites tend to have a complex genetic architecture. Nonetheless, we recovered significant associations for 23\% of the latent factors. These associations were used to inform a multi-kernel genomic prediction model, which was used to predict seed lipid and protein traits in two independent studies. Predictions for the majority of seed quality traits (9 of 13) were significantly improved compared to a conventional genomic prediction approach (genomic best linear unbiased prediction) when this prediction model was informed using associations from lipid-enriched factors. This study provides much needed insight into natural variation in the oat seed metabolome and provides genomic resources for breeders to improve selection for health-promoting seed quality traits in oat.
